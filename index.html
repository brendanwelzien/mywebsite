        <p> Coffee is loved all around the world. Many cannot go a day without a hot or cold cup of it. It just may well be the single-most important item for boosting an individual's performance daily.
            We all experience laziness and feelings of sluggishness more frequently than not. Coffee is always there for us to do better, to make the most of our days.
            With the variety of coffee styles served today, I insist that as a coffee lover, try different kinds! Stray away from your typical dosage of coffee and live on the edge!
